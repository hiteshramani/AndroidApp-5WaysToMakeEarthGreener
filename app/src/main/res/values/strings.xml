    <string name="app_description">In merely a few hundred years, we have been actively destroying
        the beautiful green Earth that was created billion of years ago. If you feel the same and
        would like to make a change, start with yourself. The following are 5 ways to make the
        Earth green:
    </string>
    <string name="point_1">1. Unplug Unused Electronics!</string>
    <string name="point_1_button">Tell me more?</string>
    <string name="point_1_descrption">Did you know that a cell phone charger can still consume electricity
                 even when a phone isn\'t connected to it? In the average home, 25% of the electricity
                 used to power home electronics is consumed while the products are turned off. To
                 stop these \"phantom\" loads when devices are not in use, unplug them or connect
                 them to power strips, which can then be turned off.</string>

    <string name="point_2">2. Recycle</string>
    <string name="point_2_button">How should I start?</string>
    <string name="point_2_description">"By recycling materials such as aluminum cans, newspapers, and glass "
                "jars, you can save energy and landfill space, conserve natural resources, and also "
                "prevent pollution. Recycling one ton of paper saves 17 mature trees, 7,000 gallons "
                "of water, three cubic yards of landfill space, two barrels of oil, and 4,100 "
                "kilowatt-hours of electricity â€“ enough energy to power the average US home for "
                "five months. Visit our recycling directory to find recycling opportunities in your " 
                "community."</string>

    <string name="point_3">3. Fix Leaks</string>
    <string name="point_3_button">Does that really matter?</string>
    <string name="point_3_description">"A faucet that leaks one drip per second can waste more than 3,000 "
                "gallons of water each year. A leaky toilet can waste up to 200 gallons of water "
                "every day. To determine whether your toilet has a leak, place a drop of food "
                "coloring in the tank; if the color appears in the bowl without flushing, you have "
                "a leak. To find and fix air leaks, ENERGY STAR offers a free guide."</string>


    <string name="point_4">4. Properly dispose off Hazardous waste</string>
    <string name="point_4_button">How?</string>
    <string name="point_4_description">"Electronics, CFLs, certain batteries, and other household hazardous "
                "wastes contain toxic materials so they should not be sent to landfills where they "
                "can pollute the surrounding land and water. A single computer monitor may contain "
                "4 pounds of lead as well as other toxic heavy metals. Many companies and municipal "
                "governments offer free collection programs, and in some cases you can even get "
                "paid to recycle old electronics."</string>


    <string name="point_5">5. Fresh, Local, Organic!</string>
    <string name="point_5_button">What does that mean?</string>
    <string name="point_5_description">"Food travels an average of 1,200 miles before it reaches your plate,"
                " so buy locally produced items to save energy and prevent emissions from going into"
                " the air. Visit USDA.gov to find a farmers market in your area. Also, choose fresh "
                "foods instead of frozen, since frozen foods require 10 times more energy to "
                "produce. Finally, organic foods are both good for the environment and good for "
                "your health since synthetic hormones, most conventional pesticides, as well as "
                "other potentially hazardous practices are not used."</string>
